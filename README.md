## ðŸ“ŒIntroductionðŸ“Œ

### Requirements :
- Solar2D (Corona simulator) [Download link](https://solar2d.com/#download)

This mini game is made in the old school way and is pure programming. In this project, I used 18 pictures for each character that you can see in the assets folder. These pictures make our characters moving! The code is well commented and wroted. If you are good at programming, You should have no problem understanding the codes. Still If you had any questions, I would be happy to help you.


This is a small project made by me and It is uncomplete (Menu, Music, Stages .etc are left to be done). You can use this project for learning and even maybe making a great game! I just wanted to try out LUA language. This was a great experience for me and I hope it will be for you as well.

Remember, Coding is a passion ðŸ’“ Good luck âœŒ
